thank you for downloading iw4x-viewhands from nurlaMODS


heres how to install 

1. drag the hands.ff into the the zone folder zone>english>
2. put the z_ViewHands.iwd into the userraw or your mod / modfolder
	1. userraw> place z_ViewHands.iwd (its the images of the hands)
	2. mod> place z_ViewHands.iwd, if you get a mismatch error in 4x or whaterver your using just open the iwd and just drag the images folder into your mod / modfolder
3. open iw4x and open the console with the tilda key ( ~ ) and type "loadzone hands" before every time you go into a game or map (if you have it in a mod you must do it to like that).
You have to loadzone everytime.
4.Have Fun!
